# WOI-1971
A action Game tributing freedom fighters of Bangladesh who fought War of Independence in 1971!

Project Name: War of Independence-1971(WOI-1971)
Project Description:

The story behind the game is about the War of Independence of Bangladesh in 1971. The Hindu-Muslim communal tensions fanned by the British colonial rulers to perpetuate their hold on India had led to the partition of India in 1947. Pakistan was created as a separate homeland for Muslims. The Province of East Pakistan was physically separated from West Pakistan by a thousand miles. Pakistan, therefore, was an unrealistic state from the very beginning. The Pakistani ruling elite controlled by the military elite subjugated the Bengalis politically, culturally and economically and therefore the disillusionment with the new nation was not surprising. In the first-ever national Parliamentary elections held in 1970 based on a one-man-one-vote basis, the Bengali nationalist forces led by Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman won a landslide victory and his party, the Awami League became the majority party in the whole of Pakistan. However, in an attempt to crush this nationalistic movement, the Pakistani Military Junta unleashed a systematic genocide against the Bengali people on the fateful night of March 25, 1971. The Junta received support only from a handful of religion-based local parties and religious fundamentalists. 

Then the war began. 

The Hero of this game is a freedom fighter named “Aresan”  whose objective is to free Bangladesh from the Pakistani Military Junta. Gamers will try to kill all of them while not hurting any innocent Bengali. The enemies will also fire and if the bullet touches the hero, the health will decrease. If a Gamer kills a certain number of Military (earns a certain number of points), he will conquer that place and the next battle place will be unlocked. In this game, the battle place would be many historical places of Bangladesh. So the main objective of the gamer in a word is “Freeing the Bengalis” as well as “Freeing Bangladesh”.

After running the game, the gamer can directly select “Start” from the “Main Menu” and start playing the game or may go to “Level Selection Menu” and select his/ her desired level. Gamers can also check controls of the game by going to “Control Options” where he/she can change the music or can turn on/off the sound. A “Story” is also provided with the game to understand the game objective. However, after starting a level the player will find helpful tips on the side of the screen and he/ she can follow them and enjoy the game. He may also interact with “Pause Menu” by pressing “Escape”. If he loses he can replay the level by pressing “Restart” or exit the game by pressing “Quit” in the “Game Over Menu”. After finishing the game also, he will get the option to “Play Next Level” or simply “Quit”. 

The War of Independence is a great event in the national history of Bangladesh. There are a few games developed on this event though 50 years passed of our independence. It is high time we made a stunning game on this event and make the world aware of the heroism of the Bangladeshi people in 1971. The game will be developed in a 2D SDL2/C++ initially for the project, but we have aspirations to make it across all platforms(Android, IOS, Windows) 3D game using the power of Unreal Engine, Unity, Autodesk, Blender etc. later on.
